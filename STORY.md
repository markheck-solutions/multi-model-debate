# How I Built This Without Being a Developer

I'm not a developer. I'm a business user who got fascinated by what AI can do.

## The Problem

In early 2025, I was working through the Power Up program using ChatGPT to help clarify vague instructions. It worked until it didn't. ChatGPT would confidently give me wrong answers, and I'd waste hours before realizing I'd been led down a dead end. So I started cross-checking with Claude and Gemini. When one model got stuck, another would catch the mistake.

That got me thinking: what if models could debate each other automatically?

## The Search

Initial web searches didn't pull up what I was looking for: something that would let me use my subscription service with Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. When I asked ChatGPT for help finding something, it told me such a tool doesn't exist, but my idea was brilliant and original. It wasn't; I later learned about CrewAI, AutoGen, and others. But those tools required API keys, and I wanted to use my existing subscriptions. So, I decided to build it anyway (*months later, I learned about proxies*🙄).

## The Build

It went badly, at first. I'd work with ChatGPT and Claude Code, hit walls, hallucinations, frustrations, and walk away. Eventually, I got it working with Claude Code.

## What I Learned

- AI can successfully build tools, if you can clearly articulate what you need
- Requirements, persistence, and implementing *Definition of Done* go a long way
- My "AI vocabulary" grew the more I used it, creating better questions, in turn, creating better results

## Why I'm Sharing This

Just a few years ago, I couldn't have built this without extensive training. With AI, now I can. That shift matters.

I'm not posting this as "look at my technical skills." I'm posting it because non-developers can now build working tools by effectively directing AI. If that sounds useful to you, here's proof it works.
